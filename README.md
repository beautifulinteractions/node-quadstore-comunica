# Comunica for quadstore

This package provides a Comunica-based SPARQL query engine for use
within quadstore. 

**IMPORTANT: this package is not meant to be used on its own but rather
as a dependency of quadstore itself.**

The engine is built using Comunica's runner, bundled into a single file
using Webpack (version **5.x**) and published in its bundled form to NPM.

Issues should be reported in quadstore's [issue tracker][2].
See also the [quadstore][0] and [comunica][1] repositories.
